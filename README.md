# ü¶õ HamaShell

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a **session and connection manager** designed for developers who need reliable, secure access to various hosts in single cli command.

It simplifies complex multi-step SSH tunneling and session setup by letting developers define their connections declaratively in a YAML file.

Unlike ad-hoc scripts, it offers **structured, secure, and controllable workflows**, making it easier to manage connections across projects and environments.

## ‚ú® Why use this tool?

‚úÖ **Declarative & reproducible** ‚Äî Define connections once in YAML and reuse them easily.

‚úÖ **Secure by design** ‚Äî Uses system environment variables to keep secrets hidden and safe.

‚úÖ **Full process control** ‚Äî Start, stop, check status, and manage connections interactively.

‚úÖ **Alias & hierarchy support** ‚Äî Organize connections by project, stage, and developer.

‚úÖ **Parallel execution** ‚Äî Run multiple sessions simultaneously without manual orchestration.

‚úÖ **Multi-cloud ready** ‚Äî Works seamlessly with AWS, Oracle Cloud, Naver Cloud, and on-premise.

‚úÖ **Portable** ‚Äî Runs on any Linux distro, integrates into CI/CD pipelines, and supports local dashboards for visibility.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
## üìô How to use

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure

First, you have to declare your yaml like this in order to apply command step by step.

```yaml
projects:
  - name: "<project-name>"
    stages:
      - name: "<stage-name>"
        developers:
          - name: "<developer-name>"
            sessions:
              - name: "<session-name>"
                description: "<brief-description>"
                steps:
                  - command: "<shell-or-ssh-command>"
                  - command: "<next-step>"
                parallel: <true|false>
aliases:
  - myapp-prod: "myapp.production.alice.db-tunnel"
global_settings:
  retries: <number>
  timeout: <seconds>
  auto_restart: <true|false>
```

Here's the definition of each declaration.

* **`projects`**
  An **array** of project objects, each declared via `- name: "<project-name>"` to instantiate and name the project (e.g. `my-awesome-app`).

* **`stages`**
  An **array** under each project, each declared via `- name: "<stage-name>"` to group its environments (e.g. `development`, `staging`, `production`).

* **`developers`**
  An **array** under each stage, each declared via `- name: "<developer-name>"` to list team members who need sessions there.

* **`sessions`**
  An **array** of connection workflows, each declared via `- name: "<session-name>"` to that the developer can run:

    * **`description: "<brief-description>"`**
      What this session does, in a nutshell.
    * **`steps`**
      Ordered **array** of commands to execute.
    * **`parallel: <true|false>`**
      Whether this session can run concurrently (`true`) or must run sequentially (`false`).

* **`aliases`**
  An **array** of aliases on groups of shell commands
  
* **`global_settings`**
  Defaults applied across **all** projects, stages, and developers:

    * `retries`: max retry attempts per failed step
    * `timeout`: per‚Äëstep timeout in seconds
    * `auto_restart`: auto‚Äërestart dropped sessions (`true`/`false`)
