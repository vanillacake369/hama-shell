# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

HamaShell is a **session and connection manager** designed for developers who need reliable, secure access to various hosts in single CLI command. It simplifies complex multi-step SSH tunneling and session setup by letting developers define their connections declaratively in a YAML file.

### Key Benefits
- **Declarative & reproducible** â€” Define connections once in YAML and reuse them easily
- **Secure by design** â€” Uses system environment variables to keep secrets hidden and safe
- **Full process control** â€” Start, stop, check status, and manage connections interactively
- **Hierarchical organization** â€” Organize connections using project.stage.service pattern
- **Parallel execution** â€” Run multiple sessions simultaneously with process isolation
- **Cross-platform ready** â€” Works on Unix/Linux and Windows systems
- **Simple & focused** â€” Clean, minimal implementation that's easy to understand and extend

## Current Implementation Status

HamaShell is currently in active development with a focus on core functionality. The implementation prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and ease of use over complex abstractions.

### âœ… Implemented Components

#### 1. Process Executor (`internal/core/executor/`)
A lightweight, thread-safe process executor with hierarchical key-based management:
- **Simple API**: `Run()`, `StopAll()`, `StopByKey()`, and `GetStatus()`
- **Thread-safe operations**: Uses `sync.Map` for concurrent access
- **Hierarchical keys**: Organizes processes by project.stage.service pattern
- **Platform-aware**: Proper signal handling for Unix/Linux (SIGTERM/SIGKILL) and Windows
- **Process isolation**: Uses process groups for better management

#### 2. Configuration System (`internal/core/config/`)
YAML-based configuration with validation:
- **Config Validator**: Parses and validates YAML configuration files
- **Type-safe structures**: Well-defined Go structs for configuration
- **Environment variable support**: Integration with system environment
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages for configuration issues

#### 3. CLI Framework (`cmd/`)
Cobra-based command-line interface:
- **Root Command**: Base command with configuration loading
- **Start Command**: Session start operations
- **Stop Command**: Session stop operations  
- **Status Command**: Session status monitoring
- **Config Command**: Configuration management

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Session state management and persistence
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Configuration file generation and management

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features
- SSH connection management
- Port forwarding and tunneling
- Terminal multiplexer integration
- Interactive TUI mode
- Shell completion scripts

## Configuration Format

HamaShell uses a simple YAML-based configuration format:

```yaml
projects:
  myapp:
    description: "Main application project"
    stages:
      dev:
        services:
          database:
            description: "Development database connection"
            commands:
              - "ssh -i ${SSH_KEY_PATH} ${DB_USER}@dev-db.example.com"
              - "mysql -u root -p${DB_PASSWORD}"
          api:
            description: "Development API server"
            commands:
              - "ssh -i ${SSH_KEY_PATH} ${API_USER}@dev-api.example.com"
              - "cd /app && npm start"

global_settings:
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3  
  auto_restart: true
```

## Development Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

This project follows TDD methodology to ensure code quality and maintainability:

#### 1. Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
- **Red**: Write failing tests first
- **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests  
- **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining tests

#### 2. Quality Gates
Before considering a feature complete:
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass  
- [ ] Code quality passes (`go fmt`, `go vet`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No performance regression

#### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Multiple scenarios in single test functions
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use interfaces for testability

## Development Commands

go get <package>            # Add new dependency
```
